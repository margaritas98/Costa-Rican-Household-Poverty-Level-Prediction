In this report, we implemented some machine learning algorithms to predict the poverty level of Costa Rican household.
First, we performed an exploratory data analysis of the dataset, then researched various features and used multiple 
algorithms to build the predictive models for the problem. At last, one of the predictive models was submitted to 
Kaggle.com for final scoring, which obtained a score of 0.414, which ranked at 209 out of 619 teams.
